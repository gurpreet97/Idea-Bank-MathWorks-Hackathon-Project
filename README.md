# Idea Bank

This project's aim was to provide an incentive and a dedicated platform for people, specifically MathWorks Employees, to put forward their ideas and bring them to life. 
With this project implemented, our employees donâ€™t have to wait for Hackdays or Hackathons for suggesting ideas.

** So the basic flow of the Idea Bank is like:-
Employees can post Ideas or any problems they are facing in general, for which any other employee can propose a solution. Employees who are interested in these solutions, can invest in the idea with something we call MWPoints(that is MathWorks Points). 
If the idea or solution is successfully implemented, then the owner of the idea or solution will get all the invested points, and also the investors will get a fixed reward, and 
On the other hand, if the idea is not implemented, the owner will not get any point, and the investors will receive a fixed percentage of what they invested. These MWPoints can be redeemed for perks like Amazon Gift cards, an extra day of vacation, or a free meal.

-> We made this project as our hackathon project organized during my internship at MathWorks.
